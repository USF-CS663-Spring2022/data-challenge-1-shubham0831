For example in the train.head() shown above, the operating airline and the Operating Airline IATA code fields seem to represent the same thing, but in different formats. Similarly Published Airline and the Published Airline IATA code seem to be representing the same thing but in different formats. Moreover these 4 fields seem to have alot of the same values as well, with Operating Airline and Published Airline, and the IATA codes for the 2 seem to be highly correlative.\n",

    "        \n",
    "        3) In the closest centroid to test case Y, compare the distance of Y with every data point, and if the distance from Y to the datapoint is below some threshold, add the cargo metric tons for that datapoint. Then, when we have the total, find divide it by the number of data points meeting the requirement, and return that number.\n",
    "        \n",
    "#### 3) Random Forests and Decision Trees\n",
